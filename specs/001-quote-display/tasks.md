## Dependencies & Execution Order

### Phase Dependencies

1. **Phase 0 (Setup)**: No dependencies - start immediately
2. **Phase 1 (Foundation)**: Depends on Setup - BLOCKS all user stories
3. **Phase 2-5 (User Stories)**: All depend on Foundation completion
   - Can run sequentially (P1 → P2 → P2 → P3) OR
   - Can run in parallel with multiple developers
4. **Phase 6 (Integration)**: Depends on desired user stories being complete
5. **Phase 7 (Dataset)**: Can run anytime after Foundation, recommended before deployment
6. **Phase 8 (Testing)**: Can run in parallel with implementation if TDD approach used

### User Story Independence

- **US1 (P1 - Continuous Display)**: Can start after Foundation ✅ No dependencies on other stories
- **US2 (P2 - Timer Config)**: Can start after Foundation ✅ Integrates with US1 but independently testable
- **US3 (P2 - Quote Grid)**: Can start after Foundation ✅ Independent of US1/US2
- **US4 (P3 - Search)**: Can start after Foundation ✅ Extends US3 but independently testable

### Parallel Execution Opportunities

**Within Foundation (Phase 1)**:
- All model creation tasks (T010-T015) can run in parallel
- Shared component creation (T020-T021) can run in parallel with services
- Static assets (T022-T025) can run in parallel with services

**Across User Stories (Phases 2-5)**:
- With 2 developers: US1 + US2 in parallel (different components)
- With 3 developers: US1 + US2 + US3 in parallel
- With 4 developers: All user stories in parallel

**Within Polish Phase (Phase 6)**:
- Documentation tasks (T088-T091) can run in parallel
- Accessibility audits (T082-T087) can run in parallel

---

## Implementation Strategy

### Recommended Approach: MVP First

1. **Week 1**: Complete Phase 0 (Setup) + Phase 1 (Foundation)
2. **Week 2**: Complete Phase 2 (US1 - Continuous Display) → **DEPLOY MVP**
3. **Week 3**: Complete Phase 3 (US2 - Timer Config) + Phase 4 (US3 - Grid) → **DEPLOY v1.1**
4. **Week 4**: Complete Phase 5 (US4 - Search) + Phase 6 (Integration) → **DEPLOY v1.2**
5. **Week 5**: Phase 7 (Dataset) + Final polish → **DEPLOY v1.0 PRODUCTION**

### MVP Definition

**Minimum Viable Product = Phase 0 + Phase 1 + Phase 2 (US1 only)**

This delivers:
- ✅ Auto-rotating Buddhist quotes
- ✅ Play/Pause/Next controls
- ✅ Audio notification
- ✅ 15-second default timer
- ✅ Buddhist-inspired design

**Total Effort**: ~25-35 hours for MVP

### Full V1 Definition

**Complete V1 = Phases 0-6 + Phase 7**

This delivers all 4 user stories + polish + full dataset

**Total Effort**: ~80-100 hours (without optional tests)
**With Tests**: ~100-120 hours (including Phase 8)

---

## Notes

- Mark tasks complete with `[X]` as you finish them
- Commit after completing each logical group of tasks (e.g., all models, one component, one user story)
- Test each user story independently before moving to next priority
- Use `[P]` marker to identify tasks safe to parallelize
- Stop at checkpoints to validate functionality before proceeding
- Document any deviations from plan in commit messages
- Update this file as new tasks are discovered during implementation
