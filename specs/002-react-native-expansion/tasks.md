- [ ] T187 [US4] Test offline timer changes on desktop (offline: change timer interval, restart app → new interval persists)
- [ ] T188 [US4] Test offline reading history on all platforms (verify history persists without internet connection)

## Dependencies & Execution Order

### Phase Dependencies

```
Phase 1 (Setup)
    ↓
Phase 2 (Foundational) ← BLOCKS all user stories
    ↓
    ├─→ Phase 3 (US1: Mobile) ← MVP, can start immediately after Phase 2
    ├─→ Phase 4 (US2: Desktop) ← Requires US1 complete (bare workflow dependency)
    ├─→ Phase 5 (US3: Wearables) ← Requires US1 complete (mobile app as sync source)
    └─→ Phase 6 (US4: Preferences) ← Incremental, overlaps with US1-US3
    ↓
Phase 7 (Polish & App Store Submission)
```

### User Story Dependencies

- **US1 (Mobile)**: Can start immediately after Phase 2 - No dependencies on other stories
- **US2 (Desktop)**: Depends on US1 complete (requires bare workflow ejection)
- **US3 (Wearables)**: Depends on US1 complete (mobile app syncs quotes to watch)
- **US4 (Preferences)**: Largely implemented within US1-US3, final verification tasks

### Critical Path

**Shortest path to MVP (Mobile Only)**:
1. Phase 1: Setup (Week 1) → 25 tasks
2. Phase 2: Foundational (Week 1-2) → 39 tasks
3. Phase 3: User Story 1 (Week 2-5) → 42 tasks
4. Phase 7: Polish & Submit Mobile Only (Week 6-7) → ~20 tasks
**Total: ~126 tasks, 7 weeks to mobile MVP launch**

**Full Multi-Platform Release**:
1. Phase 1-2: Setup + Foundational (Week 1-2) → 64 tasks
2. Phase 3: US1 Mobile (Week 2-5) → 42 tasks
3. Phase 4: US2 Desktop (Week 6-8) → 37 tasks
4. Phase 5: US3 Wearables (Week 9-11) → 32 tasks
5. Phase 6: US4 Preferences (overlaps) → 16 tasks
6. Phase 7: Polish & Submit All (Week 11-12) → 48 tasks
**Total: 239 tasks, 12 weeks to full multi-platform launch**

### Parallel Opportunities

**Within Phase 1 (Setup)**: All tasks marked [P] can run in parallel
- T002, T003 (root config)
- T005-T008 (models in parallel)
- T010-T014 (service interfaces in parallel)
- T016-T018 (utilities in parallel)
- T021-T023 (tests in parallel)

**Within Phase 2 (Foundational)**: All tasks marked [P] can run in parallel
- T030-T031, T037-T038 (config in parallel)
- T040-T044 (assets in parallel)
- T050, T055, T059 (service tests in parallel)

**Across User Stories**: Once Phase 2 completes, US1 and US4 can start in parallel (US4 is incremental)

**Recommended Team Strategy (3 developers)**:
- Week 1-2: All 3 devs → Setup + Foundational (establish foundation together)
- Week 2-5: Dev A → US1 Mobile, Dev B → US4 Preferences (incremental), Dev C → Shared module refinements
- Week 6-8: Dev A → US2 Desktop (after ejection), Dev B → Polish US1, Dev C → Documentation
- Week 9-11: Dev A → US3 Wearables, Dev B → US2 Desktop polish, Dev C → App store prep
- Week 11-12: All 3 devs → Polish & Submission

## Implementation Strategy

### MVP First (Mobile Only - Recommended)

**Goal**: Validate mobile platform value with users before investing in desktop/wearables

1. ✅ Complete Phase 1: Setup (Week 1)
2. ✅ Complete Phase 2: Foundational (Week 1-2) - BLOCKS all stories
3. ✅ Complete Phase 3: User Story 1 - Mobile (Week 2-5)
4. ✅ Complete Phase 6: User Story 4 - Preferences (subset, mobile only)
5. ✅ Complete Phase 7: Polish & Submit (mobile only subset)
6. **STOP and VALIDATE**: Deploy to TestFlight/Google Play Beta, gather user feedback (2-4 weeks)
7. If validated → proceed to desktop and wearables
8. If not validated → pivot or iterate on mobile

**Benefits**: Fastest time to user feedback, validates multi-platform architecture, smaller scope for first release

### Incremental Delivery (Platform by Platform)

**Goal**: Deliver value incrementally, validate each platform before next

1. Week 1-7: Mobile MVP (Phase 1-3 + US4 subset + Polish subset) → Launch iOS & Android
2. Week 8-10: Desktop (Phase 4 + US4 desktop) → Launch Windows & macOS
3. Week 11-13: Wearables (Phase 5 + US4 wearables) → Launch Apple Watch & Android Wear
4. Week 14: Final polish across all platforms → Update all apps with refinements

**Benefits**: Each platform validated before next, user feedback incorporated iteratively, manageable scope per release

### Full Multi-Platform Launch (Parallel Teams)

**Goal**: Launch all platforms simultaneously (requires 3+ developers)

1. Week 1-2: All devs → Setup + Foundational (foundation for all platforms)
2. Week 2-5: Dev A → Mobile, Dev B → Desktop (start after ejection Week 3), Dev C → Shared/US4
3. Week 6-8: Dev A → Wearables (iOS), Dev B → Wearables (Android), Dev C → Polish all
4. Week 9-10: All devs → Final polish, testing, app store submission
5. Week 11-12: App store review, launch coordination

**Benefits**: All platforms launch together, maximum impact, unified marketing, but higher risk and coordination complexity

## Notes

- **[P] tasks**: Different files, no dependencies, can parallelize
- **[Story] label**: Maps task to specific user story for traceability
- **Independent user stories**: Each story (US1-US4) can be tested independently after Foundational phase
- **Verify tests fail before implementing**: If tests included, write tests first, ensure red → green workflow
- **Commit frequently**: After each task or logical group for easy rollback
- **Stop at checkpoints**: Validate each story independently before moving to next priority
- **Avoid cross-story dependencies**: Keep stories independent for parallel development and incremental delivery
