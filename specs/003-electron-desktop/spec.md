# Feature Specification: Electron Desktop App

**Feature ID**: `003-electron-desktop` | **Priority**: P1 (High) | **Status**: Planning  
**Created**: 2025-11-21 | **Target Release**: v2.0.0

## Overview

Create a cross-platform desktop application using Electron that provides the same quote display, rotation, and search features as the Angular web app, but with native desktop integration features like system tray, global shortcuts, auto-launch, and customizable quote overlays.

This replaces the React Native Windows implementation (Phase 4 of 002-react-native-expansion) which encountered significant complexity with PropertySheets, monorepo structure, and build configuration. Electron provides a simpler, proven path for desktop applications.

## Motivation

**Problem**: 
- Users want a native desktop app that can run in background with system tray
- React Native Windows has proven too complex (build issues, PropertySheet conflicts, monorepo path resolution)
- Need desktop-specific features: global shortcuts, auto-launch, notification overlays

**Solution**: 
- Use Electron to package the existing Angular/TypeScript app as a native desktop application
- Add desktop-specific features via Electron APIs
- Maintain code reuse with the web app
- Support Windows, macOS, and Linux with single codebase

**Benefits**:
- **Simplicity**: Single codebase for all desktop platforms
- **Proven Technology**: Electron is mature and widely used (VS Code, Slack, Discord)
- **Code Reuse**: Leverage existing Angular app (quotes-platform)
- **Native Features**: System tray, shortcuts, overlays without complex native bridges
- **Fast Development**: Much simpler than React Native Windows

## User Stories

### US-001: System Tray Integration
**As a** desktop user  
**I want** the app to minimize to system tray  
**So that** it doesn't clutter my taskbar but stays accessible

**Acceptance Criteria**:
- Given the app is running
- When I close the main window
- Then the app minimizes to system tray with quote icon
- And I can right-click the tray icon to see menu (Show, Pause/Resume, Next Quote, Settings, Quit)
- And I can left-click to show/hide the main window

### US-002: Global Keyboard Shortcuts
**As a** desktop user  
**I want** global keyboard shortcuts  
**So that** I can control quotes without switching to the app

**Acceptance Criteria**:
- Given the app is running (even in background)
- When I press `Ctrl+Shift+Q` (or `Cmd+Shift+Q` on macOS)
- Then a quote overlay appears on top of all windows
- And pressing again dismisses it
- And `Ctrl+Shift+N` shows next quote
- And `Ctrl+Shift+P` pauses/resumes rotation

### US-003: Quote Notification Overlay
**As a** desktop user  
**I want** quotes to appear as overlays on my screen  
**So that** I see quotes without switching windows

**Acceptance Criteria**:
- Given rotation is enabled
- When timer triggers a new quote
- Then an overlay window appears at configured position (9 positions: corners, edges, center)
- And the overlay auto-dismisses after configured duration (5-30 seconds)
- And the overlay is semi-transparent (default 80% opacity)
- And I can click the overlay to dismiss it immediately
- And clicking opens full quote in main window before dismissing

### US-004: Auto-Launch on Startup
**As a** desktop user  
**I want** the app to auto-launch when I log in  
**So that** quotes are available immediately

**Acceptance Criteria**:
- Given I enable auto-launch in settings
- When my computer starts/I log in
- Then the app launches minimized to system tray
- And rotation starts automatically (if previously enabled)
- And I can disable auto-launch in settings

### US-005: Always-on-Top Mode
**As a** desktop user  
**I want** the main window to stay on top  
**So that** I always see quotes while working

**Acceptance Criteria**:
- Given I enable always-on-top in settings
- When other windows are opened
- Then the quote window stays on top
- And I can toggle this setting on/off
- And setting persists across sessions

  - Fallback to default values on corrupted preferences
  - Use built-in quotes if quotes.json missing/corrupted
  - Display dismissible error notifications to user
  - Continue app functionality with degraded state
  - Log errors for debugging
- Crash recovery (restore window state on restart)

## Out of Scope (Future Enhancements)

- Mobile app integration (handled by 002-react-native-expansion)
- Cloud sync (future feature)
- Custom themes beyond light/dark
- Widget/Dashboard integration
- Multiple quote windows simultaneously
- Web app → Desktop deep linking

## Dependencies

- Existing Angular web app (quotes-platform) must be functional
- Quote dataset (quotes.json) available
- Build environment: Node.js 20+, npm/yarn
- Windows/macOS/Linux for testing

## Constraints

- Must maintain code reuse with web app (single Angular codebase)
- Package size must be reasonable (<150MB)
- No backend server (offline-first)
- Must comply with app store guidelines if distributed via Microsoft Store / Mac App Store

## Risks & Mitigation

| Risk | Impact | Probability | Mitigation |
|------|--------|-------------|------------|
| Electron learning curve | Medium | Low | Well-documented, similar to web dev |
| Package size bloat | Medium | Medium | Optimize with Electron Builder, tree-shaking |
| System tray differences (OS-specific) | Low | Medium | Use Electron's cross-platform abstraction |
| Auto-update complexity | Medium | Low | Use electron-updater library (proven) |
| Memory usage in Chromium | Low | Low | Monitor and optimize, acceptable for desktop |

## Open Questions

1. **Icon Design**: Do we need a separate desktop icon or reuse web app icon?
   - **Decision**: Create a simple system tray icon (16x16, 32x32)

2. **Distribution**: Package via app stores or direct download?
   - **Decision**: Start with direct download (.exe, .dmg, .AppImage), app stores later

3. **Frameless vs Native Frame**: Which window style for main window?
   - **Decision**: Native frame for now (simpler), custom frameless in future

4. **Quote Overlay Positioning**: Fixed or draggable?
   - **Decision**: Fixed to 9 positions (configurable), not draggable

5. **Update Mechanism**: Auto-update or manual?
   - **Decision**: Auto-update with user prompt (electron-updater)

## Clarifications

### Session 2025-11-21

- Q: When a quote notification overlay appears on screen, how should it respond to user interaction? → A: Dismissible with click (clicking the overlay closes it immediately), and auto-dismiss after configured interval time
- Q: When the quote overlay appears, what information should be displayed? → A: Quote text + author (essential information, compact)
- Q: When the app encounters errors (e.g., corrupted preferences, missing quote data, IPC communication failures), how should it handle them? → A: Graceful degradation (fallback to defaults, notify user with dismissible message)
- Q: When a user-configured keyboard shortcut conflicts with another application or system shortcut, how should the app handle it? → A: Warn on registration failure (show message, keep previous working shortcut)
- Q: What should be the default transparency level for the quote overlay window? → A: 80% opacity
